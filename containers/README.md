# ESM4 containers
This is a very basic *0.1* version of a README for these containers.  Please feel free to
add to it or open a GitHub issue if there is something missing.
 
## Building with Docker
The Dockerfiles are set up to build an ESM4 run using Docker.  There are two Dockerfiles, 
one to build with intel oneAPI 2021.2 and one to build with GCC 10.2.0

## Building with Singularity
The Singularity definition files are included to build using intel oneAPI 2021.2 compilers.
You can build using the singularity_build.sh script
```bash
./singularity_build.sh
```

## Running using singularity
The containers are all using mpich-compatible MPI, so if you run using singularity bind 
or hybrid methods, make sure you are using some flavor of mpich and not openmpi.
