# Earth System Model 4

## What Is Included
* [src/]((https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4/tree/master/src) source code for the ESM4 model (all code is in submodules)
* [exec/]((https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4/tree/master/exec) Makefiles to compile the code 
* [run/]((https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4/tree/master/run) Simple run script

## Cloning
To clone the ESM4 model please use the recursive option
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NOAA-GFDL/ESM4.git 
```
or 
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4.git
```

## Compiling

### Building the container
The [container folder](container) provides example Dockerfiles and Signularity
definition files to use to build AM4 containers using either GCC/GFORTAN or
Intel oneAPI. There is a script that can be used to build the intel
singularity containers, and the first step of this script can be used with the
other GFDL climate models.


### Building from source
This model was originally compiled and run with the intel16 compiler.
It is recommended that you compile with an intel compiler.

Compiling assumes that you have an intel compiler, MPI (impi, mpich,
openmpi, etc), netcdf, and hdf5 in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH.
It is also assumed that nf-config and nc-config are in your path. 
If you work on a machine with modules, you may need to load these 
packages into your environment.

Makefiles have been included in the 
[exec/](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4/tree/master/exec) folder.
There are several option for compiling, which can be found in the 
[template/intel.mk](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4/blob/master/exec/templates/intel.mk).  
You may need to edit the template/intel.mk to update the compiler names
or add any CPPDEF options specific for your system.
The most common compile with optimizations on and with openmp would be 
```bash
cd exec
make OPENMP=on
```
If you would like to compile with *-O2* instead of *-O3* do
```bash
make REPRO=on OPENMP=on
```
To compile with *-O0* and debug flags do
```bash
make BLD_TYPE=DEBUG OPENMP=on
```
Compiling with openMP is optional.


Here are examples of how to compile the model on various systems:

gaea (NOAA RDHPCS cray system)
```bash
module load intel
module load cray-netcdf
module load cray-hdf5
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NOAA-GFDL/ESM4.git
cd ESM4/exec
make MKL_LIBS="none" OPENMP=y
```
Compiling on orion (MSU)
```bash
module load intel impi netcdf hdf5
export LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBRARY_PATH}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NOAA-GFDL/ESM4.git
cd ESM4/exec
make OPENMP=on
```

## Model running
A work directory needed for running the model can be obtained from
ftp://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov/users/ESM4/ESM4Documentation/GFDL-ESM4/inputData/ESM4_rundir.tar.gz

The directory contains input.nml as the namelist, various input tables needed
for running the model, and model input files in a folder called INPUT/.  There
is also a directory named RESTART/ that should be empty at the beginning of
each run. 

There is a skeleton of a run script named [run/ESM4_run.sh](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/ESM4/blob/master/run/ESM4_run.sh).  You must update this
script to run the model.  Include a path to the work directory and the executable.
You should also update the program you need to run the model on your system.  The
default for this script is `srun`.
